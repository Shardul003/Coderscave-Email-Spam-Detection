<h1><u><b>Overview</b></u></h1>
The goal of this project is to develop a robust email spam detection system using machine learning techniques. By analyzing the content and characteristics of emails, the system should accurately classify incoming emails as either spam or legitimate (ham).

<h1><u><b>Contents</b></u></h1>
The notebook includes the following sections:
<br>
<b>Data Preprocessing:</b> Dropping unnecessary columns and cleaning the data.<br>
<b>Visualization: </b>Generating word clouds to visualize the most frequent words in spam and ham emails.<br>
<b>Feature Extraction:</b> Extracting relevant features from the email content.<br>
<b>Model Building:</b> Constructing machine learning models for classification.<br>
<b>Model Evaluation:</b> Evaluating the performance of the models using appropriate metrics.<br>
<h1><u><b>Getting Started</b></u></h1>
To run the notebook, you can open it in Google Colab by clicking the "Open in Colab" badge above. Alternatively, you can clone the repository and run the notebook locally if you have Jupyter installed.
